# enigma-dev-x

This repository can be used to get up and running on a local Enigma Blockchain developer testnet (enigmadev) to start working with the cosmwasm-based smart contracts (soon to be secret contracts!).

A few important notes:
- smart contracts in this repo are a precursor to Enigma's Secret Contracts, which enable data privacy
- smart contracts are written in Rust and based on cosmwasm, and the module is referred to as `compute` in the Enigma Blockchain. This will be also true of Secret Contracts!
- these cosmwasm-based smart contracts should be reusable and easily modified once we incorporate data privacy

## Setup the Local Developer Testnet

The developer blockchain is configured to run inside a docker container. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your environment (Mac, Windows, Linux).

Open a terminal window and change to your project directory. Then clone the EnigmaBlockchain repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/enigmampc/EnigmaBlockchain.git
```

Change directory:

```
$ cd EnigmaBlockchain
```

In the same terminal, create the docker image by issuing the build command and tagging it as _enigmadev_. We'll use that tag later instead of the container id, which can be a bit cryptic and hard to remember.

The command below tells Docker to follow the instructions in the Dockerfile_devnet to build the image.

```
docker build -f Dockerfile_devnet -t enigmadev .
```

To verify the _enigmadev_ docker image was created:

```
docker image ls enigmadev
```

Now that we've created the local EnigmaBlockchain docker image we can run it as a container:

```
docker run -d \
 -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -p 1317:1317 \
 --name enigmadev enigmadev
```

![](docker-run.png)


**NOTE**: The _engimadev_ docker container can be stopped by using (in a separate terminal) `docker stop enigmadev` and re-started 
using `docker start -i enigmadev`.


At this point you're running a local EnigmaBlockchain full-node.

In another terminal run a `bash` shell in the `enigmadev` container so we can view and manage the enigma keys:

```
docker exec -it enigmadev /bin/bash
```

The local blockchain has a couple of keys setup for you (similar to accounts if you're familiar with Truffle Ganache). The keys are stored in the `test` keyring backend, which makes it easier for local development and testing.

```
enigmacli keys list --keyring-backend test
````

![](enigmacli-keys-list.png)


At this point you've:

1. Created the local Enigma developer testnet

2. Started the EnigmaBlockchain

3. Listed the keys/accounts 


This process is similar to `discovery init` and `discovery start` and may be streamlined in the future.




## Setup Enigma Smart Contracts (cosmwasm)

These are the steps required to get setup to use _compute_ (Enigma Blockchain's initial implementation of cosmwasm smart contracts)

1. Install Rust, using the rustup installer
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. Install cargo generate
```
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
```

3. Add rustup target wasm32 for both stable and nightly
```
rustup default stable
rustup target list --installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

rustup install nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

## Create Initial Smart Contract

4. Generate the smart contract project
```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/confio/cosmwasm-template.git --name <your-project-name>
```
The generate creates a directory with the project name and has this structure:

```
Cargo.lock	Developing.md	LICENSE		Publishing.md	examples	schema		tests
Cargo.toml	Importing.md	NOTICE		README.md	rustfmt.toml	src
```

## Compile

5. Built smart contract â€”> wasm (compile)
```
cargo wasm
```

## Unit Tests

Run unit tests
```
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo unit-test
```

## Integration Tests

The integration tests are under the `tests/` directory and run as:

```
cargo integration-test
```

## Generate Msg Schemas

We can also generate JSON Schemas that serve as a guide for anyone trying to use the contract, to specify which arguments they need.

Auto-generate msg schemas (when changed):

```
cargo schema
```


## Deploy Smart Contract

Before deploying or storing the contract on the testnet, need to run the cosmwasm optimizer.

### Optimize compiled wasm

```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/code \
  --mount type=volume,source=$(basename $(pwd))_cache,target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  confio/cosmwasm-opt:0.7.3
```
The contract wasm needs to be optimized to get a smaller footprint. Cosmwasm notes state the contract would be too large for the blockchain unless optimized. This example contract.wasm is 1.8M before optimizing, 90K after.

The optimization creates two files:
- contract.wasm
- hash.txt

### Store the Smart Contract on our local Testnet

```
# First lets start it up again, this time mounting our project's code inside the container.
docker run -d -p 26657:26657 -p 26656:26656 -p 1317:1317 \
 -v $(pwd):/root/code \
 --name enigmadev enigmadev
 ```

Upload the optimized contract.wasm to the enigma-testnet:

```
cd code

enigmacli tx compute store contract.wasm --from a --gas auto -y --keyring-backend test
```

You can also store [verified code](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/tooling/verify)

Uploading verified code requires 2 additional params, source of the crate, and the builder that optimized the compiled wasm.

```
enigmacli tx compute store contract.wasm \
--builder="confio/cosmwasm-opt:0.7.3" \
--source="https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<your-project-name>/0.0.1/download" \
--from a --gas auto -y
```

### Querying the Smart Contract and Code

12. List current smart contract code
```
enigmacli query compute list-code
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "creator": "enigma1klqgym9m7pcvhvgsl8mf0elshyw0qhruy4aqxx",
    "data_hash": "0C667E20BA2891536AF97802E4698BD536D9C7AB36702379C43D360AD3E40A14",
    "source": "",
    "builder": ""
  }
]
```

### Instantiate the Smart Contract

At this point the contract's been uploaded and stored on the testnet, but there's no "instance." 
This is like `discovery migrate` which handles both the deploying and creation of the contract instance, except in Cosmos the deploy-execute process consists of 3 steps rather than 2 in Ethereum. You can read more about the logic behind this decision, and other comparisons to Solidity, in the [cosmwasm documentation](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/smart-contracts). These steps are:
1. Upload Code - Upload some optimized wasm code, no state nor contract address (example Standard ERC20 contract)
2. Instantiate Contract - Instantiate a code reference with some initial state, creates new address (example set token name, max issuance, etc for my ERC20 token)
3. Execute Contract - This may support many different calls, but they are all unprivileged usage of a previously instantiated contract, depends on the contract design (example: Send ERC20 token, grant approval to other contract)

To create an instance of this project we must also provide some JSON input data, a starting count.

```bash
INIT="{\"count\": 100000000}"
CODE_ID=1
enigmacli tx compute instantiate $CODE_ID "$INIT" --from a --label "my counter" -y --keyring-backend test
```

With the contract now initialized, we can find its address
```bash
enigmacli query compute list-contract-by-code 1
```
Our instance is enigma18vd8fpwxzck93qlwghaj6arh4p7c5n89d2p9uk

We can query the contract state
```bash
CONTRACT=enigma18vd8fpwxzck93qlwghaj6arh4p7c5n89d2p9uk
enigmacli query compute contract-state smart $CONTRACT "{\"get_count\": {}}"
```

And we can increment our counter
```bash
enigmacli tx compute execute $CONTRACT "{\"increment\": {}}" --from a --keyring-backend test
```

## Smart Contract

### Project Structure

The source directory (`src/`) has these files:
```
contract.rs  lib.rs  msg.rs  state.rs
```

The `contract.rs` file is the one that developers modify, though I found smart contract-specific code in `state.rs` and `msg.rs`. My understanding is that the developer will modify `contract.rs` for the logic, `state.rs` for the data the contract will use as state, and  `msg.rs` to define the messages handled by the contract.

```
state.rs
msg.rs
```

The `msg.rs` file is where the InitMsg parameters are specified (like a constructor), the types of Query (GetCount) and Handle[r] (Increment) messages, and any custom structs for each query response.

```
use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct InitMsg {
    pub count: i32,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
pub enum HandleMsg {
    Increment {},
    Reset { count: i32 },
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "lowercase")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    // GetCount returns the current count as a json-encoded number
    GetCount {},
}

// We define a custom struct for each query response
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct CountResponse {
    pub count: i32,
}

```

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are coded in the `contract.rs` file itself:

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use cosmwasm::errors::Error;
    use cosmwasm::mock::{dependencies, mock_env};
    use cosmwasm::serde::from_slice;
    use cosmwasm::types::coin;

    #[test]
    fn proper_initialization() {
        let mut deps = dependencies(20);

        let msg = InitMsg { count: 17 };
        let env = mock_env(&deps.api, "creator", &coin("1000", "earth"), &[]);

        // we can just call .unwrap() to assert this was a success
        let res = init(&mut deps, env, msg).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(0, res.messages.len());

        // it worked, let's query the state
        let res = query(&deps, QueryMsg::GetCount {}).unwrap();
        let value: CountResponse = from_slice(&res).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(17, value.count);
    }
...
